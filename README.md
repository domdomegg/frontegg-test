# frontegg-test

Small test app to try out Frontegg for Google Login.

I built this back in 2022 while trying to figure out how we could improve our authentication solution at Raise.

Ultimately we decided that using Frontegg was probably more than we needed, and came with a pricetag to match (especially if we wanted to add SAML SSO support later). Also, we kept running into bugs with the login UI which didn't give us much confidence in their reliability at that time.
